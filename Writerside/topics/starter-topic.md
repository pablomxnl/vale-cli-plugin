## Configuration

The plugin has 3 settings
To set this up go to 

<kbd>Settings</kbd> (or <kbd>Preferences</kbd> if using mac) -> <kbd>Tools</kbd> -> <kbd>Vale CLI</kbd> 

![Plugin settings](plugin_settings.png){border-effect="line"}

1. Vale full absolute path: Only required when the plugin fails to find it's location by executing `which vale` or `where vale.exe` commands.
2. Vale settings file location (`.vale.ini` or `_vale.ini`): required when want to use a configuration file located in a path different from [where the binary looks for it in it's search process](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/config/#search-process).  
3. File extensions to lint, by default set to `adoc,md,rst` ; requires at least one extension. 

Alternatively, whenever the plugin is invoked with incomplete configuration, the settings can be entered by clicking on the notification link:

* As markers on the editor of a supported file.

### Results in plugin tool window

When executing the global tools menu action, the plugin will execute the Vale CLI against the configured file types at the project level. 
The plugin tool window shows a summary of the number of issues per severity found.

### Results in problem view

<img src="results_problemview_annotator.png" alt="Results in problem view" border-effect="line" />

The Vale CLI alerts can also be visualized on the problem view clicking on them will navigate to the line where Vale CLI found the problem.  
Additionally, these alerts are also visible on the editor as markers.

## Quick fixes

When the Vale CLI suggests to replace a phrase, the plugin will offer a Quick Fix action on the problem view and on the editor.

## Feedback 

There are several ways to give feedback.

### Feature request and Bug report plugin toolwindow toolbar actions

<img src="toolbar_feedback_actions.png" alt="Toolwindow toolbar actions" />

Since version 0.0.22 a toolbar has been added with a feature request and bug report button.

Each one of these buttons opens your default browser to create a gitlab issue with a predefined template, for the bug report it gathers automatically information about your specific JetBrains IDE such as name, version, java JDK version used, Operating System and version and version of the plugin installed (a gitlab.com account is required).

### Automatic error reporting

Sometimes fatal errors like the pesky NPE or other runtime exceptions ship with the plugin. When this happens there is a little blinking notification with a link "See details and submit report". 

<img src="error_handler_notification.png" alt="Notification of a fatal internal error" />

If clicked the submit error report screen it's shown as follows

<img src="error_handler_report.png" alt="Notification of a fatal internal error" />

Similar to the bug report it gathers automatically information about the IDE, Operating System,JDK and plugin version installed and submits this information to Sentry. The author then gets a notification and possibly later you will see a new gitlab issue with `sentry` label.

Except, if the plugin is outdated, the error it is ignored and a notification like the following appears after submitting the error report:
