## Configuration

The plugin has 3 setings
To setup this up go to 

<kbd>Settings</kbd> (or <kbd>Preferences</kbd> if using mac) -> <kbd>Tools</kbd> -> <kbd>Vale CLI</kbd> 

![Plugin settings](plugin_settings.png){border-effect="line"}

1. Vale full absolute path: Only required when the plugin fails to find it's location by executing `which vale` or `where vale.exe` commands.
2. Vale settings file location (`.vale.ini` or `_vale.ini`): required when want to use a configuration file located in a path different from [where the binary looks for it in it's search process](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/config/#search-process).  
3. File extensions to lint, by default set to `adoc,md,rst` ; requires at least one extension. 

Alternatively, whenever the plugin is invoked with incomplete configuration, the settings can be entered by clicking on the notification link:
