=== Pre-Requistes

NOTE: Requires Vale CLI installed.
Please review the https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/[Vale CLI installation guide]

* https://vale.sh[Vale CLI] installed and with minimal https://vale.sh/generator/[styles configured].
* Install the dependencies of the https://vale.sh/docs/topics/scoping/#formats[vale formats] configured. +
For example, to check `asciidoctor` and `reStructuredTex` documents, Vale CLI requires `asciidoctor gem` and python package `rst2html` accordingly in the system path. +
To verify the setup, run `vale adoc_file_or_rst_file` in the integrated terminal. +
In some operating systems using a version manager like `rvm` or `pyenv` can help to solve these path issues. In others cases, helps to install these dependencies with the OS package manager.

== Configuration

The plugin has 3 configurations:

   . vale binary location: required when the plugin couldn't find it automatically in the system path
   . vale settings file location: required when want to use a configuration file located in a path different from where the binary looks for it.
   . file extensions to check:  pre-set to `md,adoc`, it requires at least one extension.

To enter this configuration go to
`Settings` -> `Tools` -> `Vale CLI`
